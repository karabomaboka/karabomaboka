### 🙋🏽 Who Am I?

I'm Karabo — a software engineer from South Africa who went all-in on **Nuxt.js**. After dabbling in multiple stacks, I found my sweet spot building fast, dynamic, and intuitive apps with Vue and Nuxt. I don't just write code — I architect solutions, solve problems, and obsess over developer experience.

Think clean code, thoughtful design, and shipping stuff that *just works*.

---

### 🛠️ What I Actually Do

Forget the buzzwords — here’s what I really get into:

- Breaking down complex ideas into clean, maintainable architecture
- Building apps with **Nuxt** like my life depends on it (because sometimes, it feels like it does 😄)
- Connecting the dots: APIs, databases, real-time logic
- Making sure the code not only works, but performs like a champ
- Writing docs that future-me actually appreciates
- Teaching, supporting, and lifting the dev community around me

---

### ⚙️ My Current Stack

**Front-End**

- 🧪 Nuxt 3 (Composition API, Server Routes, Nitro, Vite)
- Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Svelte, Bootstrap

**Back-End**

- Node.js, Firebase Functions, Express
- Python + FastAPI or Django for APIs
- REST, GraphQL, Webhooks

**DevOps & Data**

- Git, Linux, CI/CD

### ✨ My Dev Philosophy

> **“Clarity beats cleverness. Readability wins.”**  
> Code should be easy to read, test, and refactor — especially by *future me*.
